## PROBLEM

There are two ongoing problems for this Houston non-profit organization raising concern for all skate holders, including funders, the board, and the public:

âž¡ Decreasing enrollment for the Financial Opportunity Center, where clients come in to improve their financial means by attending the financial workshop and job training.

âž¡ Increasing need for Houston families to get utility assistance, but applications also take longer to process due to lack of staffing and stricter funder requirement.

The center's FOC is funded by a few major non-profit organizations in the Greater Houston area. One of them, United Way, is to create the opportunity for individuals and families in the Greater Houston community to thrive. United Way will focus on and invest in high-quality programs focused on serving ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) and those living below the Federal Poverty Level.  One of the programs, the Financial Opportunity Center (FOC), is a career and personal financial service center that focuses on the ALICE population's financial bottom line. FOC provides families with services across three areas:

1. Employment Placement and Career Improvement
2. Financial Education and Coaching
3. Public Benefits Access

For some time, our center's FOC has been struggling with decreasing enrollment, especially in 1 and 2 above.  FOC is receiving the largest amount of funding out of all departments. *If FOC is unable to meet the program goal this year, the funder will reduce or drop the funding entirely, jeopardizing the whole organization's financial position as a whole.* Under 3. Public Benefits Access, one of the primary sub-programs is CEAP, which helps pay 12 months of electricity and gas for lower-income families. With rising global temperature (especially in TX!) and increased energy costs to cool the homes, this is a necessary and popular benefit program in Houston.

We will explore the FOC problem in this folder. Please find the CEAP problem and analysis at: https://github.com/emily1618/Data-Portfolio/tree/main/CEAP


### Break down of FOC problem:
- KPI to considered: # of enrollment and # of successful exit
- Enrollment is counted when a client completes a zoom or in-person orientation, a soft credit check, and signed paperwork.
- Successful exit is when the client complete a financial coaching consultation, job or class training, improve credit score or exit with a job within six months to one year.
- Decreasing enrollment started drastically falling since 2017. 
- FOC received the most funding out of all other departments. 
- There are a few possible causes. One of them is the center is outreaching to the wrong demographic group. 


#### What I completed:
âœ” I shared the enrollment data insight via the Tableau dashboard to the stakeholders. I also recommend ideas to outreach to a specific population so marketing strategy can be more focused, producing more interest in enrollment.

## FOC DATASET

Enrollment data from 2012 to 2022.

Accuracy: data is accurate because the center verified client information with their ID. For each training/consultation, the staff will need to record to be counted for. 

Relevancy: data is relevant because there are paperwork, document, and credit check to verify client information.

Completeness: data is not complete; there many missing data that need further investigation.

Timeliness: data is up to date.

Consistency: the data is consistent. Data is entered through the Salesforce platform. Therefore, the platform should have a consistent format.

ðŸš« Because the dataset contains real client names and information. This notebook is public hence some of the codes are commented out, so no df containing the client name will be printed. 



#
## FOC DATA CLEANING

The dataset is first cleaned in Excel including but not limited to the following:
- birthday data type
- birthday entered wrong (eg: 1/1/5674, 12-5/1968, 123/2/1970, Agust 5)
- birthday not completed
- using letter O instead of number 0 in dates
- spell out birthday month (eg: August, 30,)
- numerical currency data that's written out (eg: $300/month, 500 job + $400 ssi)
- currency having . and , in wrong places (eg: 6.66.7, 134,05)
- number stored as object or the number is stored as text (use `=VALUE()`) to convert back. Use `=IF(AK2="","",VALUE(AK2))` to convert to float number in excel if containing NaN in rows.
- extremely high monthly income
- negative birthday
- negative income
- find all and replace to fix spelling in the utility company columns to keep it consistent (eg: V24/7, v 247, V247 company)
- turn name into cap for first letter using `=PROPER`
- grab the year off birthday using `=TEXT(cell, "yyyy")`
- use `=LEFT()` or `=RIGHT()` to grab the specific number for household size-long
- use text to column to fix values
- `=DOLLAR()` to convert currency if needed

Using `describe()` in Python, I run into more issue with the numerical data so the dataset needs to be examine and clean further in Excel.

## FOC DASHBOARD AND RECOMMENDATION


#### Recommendation:

1. June is the month with the most enrollment. A marketing campaign can be put in place in February/March leading up to June, so the center can "catch" some potential clients in May and maximize enrollment potential in June. The FOC should look into the November enrollment spike to have a mini-marketing campaign in September leading up to November.


2. Partnering up with health insurance agents and Marketplace insurance organization. The FOC can provide job training while clients can have adequate health insurance when they're in training for a career and unable to have income/health insurance. 

3. Homeowners have double the average household income than renters. Therefore, partnerships with apartments can create a beneficial relationship for both businesses. For example, suppose a client is late on rent or subsidized. In that case, the FOC can offer temporary rental assistance, followed by required financial counseling/ job training classes, to the household members to land a higher paying job and improve their living situation 

4. Instead of concentrating on the main zip code(77036). The FOC can pick 2 to 3 more zip codes and market their services to those zip. 

5. As technology advances, the FOC can create an educational plan offering more digital literacy classes. The average age is 50 for the digital literacy category. The long-term goal is to reduce the public benefit assistance needs for the 60 age group once the 50 age group clients enter into 60's.
