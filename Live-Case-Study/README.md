Just some random things now...

This is an ongoing business problem a current non-profit organization is facing now. 

Data: Real utility assistance program data in Harris County, TX.

Problem: There is not enough staffs during the busy season to process the utility assistance application. The organization also is using an system that was in place 5+ years ago. We need a new direction, improve the process, hire more staffs and increase fundings to sustain this program. 

Solution: The system is replaced from a 10 years old paper system into eletronic version including online application and online scheduling. The data is stored in the cloud and is udpated automatically instead of manually typing in every week into Access. 

Goal: Use the data to predict how many staffs are needed during the busiest months and to negotiate new contract with the funder to increase funding for the program.
