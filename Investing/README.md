### INTRODUCTION

This project is not set out to recommend any stocks. I'm not a trader, not even close. However, it is my interest to learn more about how to read charts and using technical indicators. I learned the ichimoku code from Derek Banas, an Udemy instructor. He is an awesome coder and I will be continuing learning from his videos. I recommend anyone interested in the same topic NOT to just copy the code. It helps to type out all the code, google/stackoverflow anything you don't understand, and most importantly, google the concept behind ichimoku cloud, moving average, etc. Once you have a more than a basic understanding, try to use the code to build your own portfolio and use the ichimoku cloud to test trades. I only scratched the surface and there are so much more to learn! 

Dataset:
- From `import yfinance as yf` and https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener
- Due to the amount of time it required to download all the stocks from NASDAQ, I only picked the top 300 based on market cap. If you have time, please run on all of the NASDAQ tickers!
- I used a 5 year timeframe. To enhance your analysis, please also run a 6 months and 1 year analysis to compare. 

The code is seperated into 3 parts:
### üìä [EDA on NYSE and NASDAQ](#eda-on-nyse-and-nasdaq)
### üå¶ [Downloading Stock Data and Building the Ichimoku Cloud](#downloading-stock-data-and-building-the-ichimoku-cloud)
### üßó‚Äç [Finding a Optimal Portfolio with Sharpe Ratio](#finding-a-optimal-portfolio-with-sharpe-ratio)


**WARNING:** This code is pretty long!
