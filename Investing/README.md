INTRODUCTION
This project is not set out to recommend any stocks. I'm not a trader, not even close. However, it is my interest to learn more about how to read stock charts and using technical indicators and see how it compare to trade based on speculation and news (of course, these two create volatility offering short term opportunities). I learned many of the code below from Derek Banas, an Udemy instructor. I recommend anyone interested in the same topic NOT to just copy the code. It helps to type out all the code, google/stackoverflow anything you don't understand, and most importantly, google the concept behind ichimoku cloud, moving average, etc. Once you have a more than a basic understanding of the concept and the code, try to use the code to build your own portfolio and use the ichimoku cloud to test few trades. I only scratched the surface and there are so much more to learn! I will be continuing to learn more, create a Tableau visulization on the EDA, and building up this project ðŸ˜ƒ.

The data is from yfinance and https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener

The code is seperated into 3 parts:

EDA on NYSE and NASDAQ

Downloading Stock Data and Building the Ichimoku Cloud.

Finding a Optimal Portfolio with Sharpe Ratio.

Sidenote: Due to the amount of time it required to download all the stocks from NASDAQ, I only picked the top 200 based on market cap. Of course, you can run on all of the NASDAQ tickers if you would like.
