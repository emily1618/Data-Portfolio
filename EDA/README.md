## Exploratory Data Analysis
- EDA is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset.
- Concepts:
  - Descriptive Statistics, which is a way of giving a brief overview of the dataset we are dealing with, including some measures and features of the sample
  - Grouping data [Basic grouping with group by], pivot table
  - ANOVA, Analysis Of Variance, which is a computational method to divide variations in an observations set into different components.
  - Correlation and correlation methods
- Some steps:
  - Get maximum insights from a data set
  - Uncover underlying structure
  - Extract important variables from the dataset
  - Detect outliers and anomalies(if any)
  - Test underlying assumptions
  - Determine the optimal factor settings

### R
- Tidyverse package for tidying up the data set
- ggplot2 package for visualizations
- corrplot package for correlation plot
- Some other basic functions to manipulate data like strsplit (), cbind (), matrix () and so on.
