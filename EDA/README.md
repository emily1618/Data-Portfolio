## Exploratory Data Analysis
- EDA is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset.
- Some steps:
  - Get maximum insights from a data set
  - Uncover underlying structure
  - Extract important variables from the dataset
  - Detect outliers and anomalies(if any)
  - Test underlying assumptions
  - Determine the optimal factor settings
