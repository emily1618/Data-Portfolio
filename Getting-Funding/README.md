# INTRODUCTION

To begin, there are two ongoing problems for this Houston non-profit organization raising concern for all skate holders including funders, the board, and the public:

âž¡ Decreasing enrollment for the Financial Opportunity Center, where clients come in to improve their financial means by attending financial workshop and job training.

âž¡ Increasing need for Houston families to get utility assistance, but applications also take longer time to process due lack of manpower and stricter funder requirement.

The center's FOC is funded by few major non-profit organizations in the Greater Houston area. One of them, United Way, is to create the opportunity for individuals and families in the Greater Houston community to thrive. United Way will focus on and invest in high-quality programs focused on serving ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) and those living below the Federal Poverty Level.  One of the programs, the Financial Opportunity Center (FOC) is a career and personal financial service center that focus on the financial bottom line for the ALICE population. FOC provides families with services across three areas:

1. Employment Placement and Career Improvement
2. Financial Education and Coaching
3. Public Benefits Access

For some times, our center's FOC has been struggling with decreasing enrollment, especially in 1 and 2 above. Under 3. Public Benefits Access, one of the primary sub-programs is CEAP, which helps pay 12 months of electricity and gas for lower income families. With global rising temperature (especially in TX!) and increased energy cost to cool the homes, this is necessary and popular benefit program in the Houston.

We were facing problems such as:
- Not enough staffs during the busy season to handle the number of clients and process the applications. 
- The organization also is using an outdated system that was in place 7+ years ago. 


### What I completed :
âœ” I replaced the system from a 10 years old paper system/storage into electronic version including online application and online scheduling. The data is stored in the cloud and is updated automatically instead of manually typing in every week into Access. Report can be downloaded and generated under minutes.

âœ” Using data insight and visualization, I negotiated an new contract with the funder, increasing pay per application by **100%** for the utility assistance program. 

âœ” I also secured **100%** funding from another source for two years without annual contract renewal (which is typically require to submit RFP and renew each year based on performance).

### What I will do:
- Using data to predict how many staffs are needed during the busiest months.

- **Even though it's a non-profit, the center will still need to run like a for-profit business to sustain. Only way is to increase enrollment so the center can increase funding. More enrollment means the center is growing and able to help the Houston community efficiently. This  will allow the center to request for additional funding from existing/new funders. I will be exploring the data provided by this FOC from 2012 to 2022 to provide insights on how to increase enrollment.**

### DATA

There will be **two** dataset. One is FOC client enrollment data and one is CEAP utility assistant client data from 2021. Each dataset will be analyzed seperately. 

ðŸš« Because the dataset contains real client names and information. This notebook is public, hence some of the code are commented out so no df containing the client name will be printed. Snippet of CEAP dataset:

### Excel

The dataset is first cleaned in Excel including but not limited to the following:
- birthday data type
- birthday entered wrong (eg: 1/1/5674, 12-5/1968, 123/2/1970)
- birthday not completed
- using letter O instead of number 0 in dates
- spell out birthday month (eg: August, 30,)
- numerical currency data that's written out (eg: $300/month, 500 job + $400 ssi)
- currency having . and , in wrong places (eg: 6.66.7, 134,05)
- number stored as object or the number is stored as text (use `=VALUE()`) to convert back. Use `=IF(AK2="","",VALUE(AK2))` to convert to float number in excel if containing NaN in rows.
- extremely high monthly income
- negative birthday
- negative income
- find all and replace to fix spelling in the utility company columns to keep it consistent (eg: V24/7, v 247, V247 company)
- turn name into cap for first letter using `=PROPER`
- grab the year off birthday using `=TEXT(cell, "yyyy")`
- use `=LEFT()` or `=RIGHT()` to grab the specific number for household size-long
- use text to column to fix values

Using `describe()` in Python, I run into more issue with the numerical data so the dataset needs to be examine and clean further in Excel.
