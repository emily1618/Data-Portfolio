# INTRODUCTION

To begin, there are two ongoing problems for this Houston non-profit organization raising concern for all skateholders including funders, the board, and the public:

- Decreasing enrollment for the Financial Opportunity Center, where clients come in to improve their financial means by attending financial workshop and job training.
- Increasing public benefit assistance in the utility assistance category but lack of staffs working on cases and more detailed requirement from the funders.

The center's FOC is funded by few major non-profit organizations in the Greater Houston area. One of them, United Way, is to create the opportunity for individuals and families in the Greater Houston community to thrive. United Way will focus on and invest in high-quality programs focused on serving ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) and those living below the Federal Poverty Level.  One of the program, the Financial Opportunity Center (FOC) is a career and personal financial service center that focus on the financial bottom line for the ALICE population. FOC provides families with services across three areas:

1. Employment Placement and Career Improvement
2. Financial Education and Coaching
3. Public Benefits Access

For some times, our center's FOC has been struggling with dercreasing enrollment, especially in 1 and 2 above. Under 3. Public Benefits Access, one of the primary sub-program is LIHEAP, which helps pay 12 months of electricity and gas for lower income families. With global rising temperature (espiecally in TX!) and increased energy cost to cool the homes, this is necessary and popular benefit program in the Houston.

We were facing problems such as:
- Not enough staffs during the busy season to handle the amount of clients and process the applications. 
- The organization also is using an outdated system that was in place 7+ years ago. 


### What I completed :
✅ I replaced the system from a 10 years old paper system/storage into eletronic version including online application and online scheduling. The data is stored in the cloud and is udpated automatically instead of manually typing in every week into Access. Report can be downloaded and generated under minutes.

✅ Using data insight and visualization, I negotiated an new contract with the funder, increasing pay per application by **100%** for the utility assistance program. 

✅ I also secured **100%** funding from another source for two years without annual contract renewal (which is typically require to submit RFP and renew each year based on performance).

### What I will do:
- Using data to predict how many staffs are needed during the busiest months.

- **Even though it's a non-profit, the center will still need to run like a for-profit business to sustain. Only way is to increase enrollment so the center can increase funding. More enrollment means the center is growing and able to help the Houston community efficiently. This  will allow the center to request for additional fundings from exisiting/new funders. I will be exploring the data provided by this FOC from 2012 to 2022 to provide insights on how to increase enrollment.**
